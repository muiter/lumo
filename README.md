to set up the code:

1) Navigate to main folder (I named it lumo) in terminal
2) Type 'npm install' (I used npm v3.9.3/node v6.2.1, but node v4.1.0 worked as well so that shouldn't be a problem)
3) After that's done installing type 'npm start'
4) Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and you should see it!
